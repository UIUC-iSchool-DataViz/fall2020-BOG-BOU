  We talk about the basics of using Traitlets and data binding in visualization.

## Last Week

 * Transformations
 * Colors and color mapping
 * HSV/RGB/etc
 * Image visualization

---

## Review: Color Mapping

 * Choose an accessible, appropriate colormap
   * "Am I showing different things?"
   * "Can these things be compared directly?"
   * "Do I want to demonstrate deviation or gradiation?"
 * Mapping between "data space" and "color space" requires normalization and
   color mapping
   * Normalization: $f(v) => v' \in [0, 1]$
   * Color mapping: $g(v) => RGBA$

## Today

 * Data Binding with Traitlets
 * Widgets and Traitlets in Jupyter

## Traits and Data

There are two underlying libraries we utilize for interactivity in Jupyter.
The first, `traitlets`, provides methods for datatype-verification and
"watching" for changes.

```#python
import traitlets

class MyObject(traitlets.HasTraits):
    name = traitlets.Unicode()
    age = traitlets.Int()

my_obj = MyObject(name = "Weezer", age = 26)
```

---

## Watching Traitlets

Once we have an object that has traits, we can watch that object for changes.

```#python

def name_changed(change):
    print(change['new'])

my_obj.observe(name_changed, ['name'])
```

In this case, we are watching the trait `name` for changes.  When a change
occurs, the function `name_changed` is called.  The argument is a dict with
these values:

 * `new`: the new value the trait has
 * `old`: the previous value
 * `type`: the type of change
 * `owner`: the object that owns this trait
 * `name`: the name of the trait

## Widgets

We can use the `ipywidgets` library to build out widgets in Jupyter notebooks.
These widgets can be quite extensive with many different operations;
additionally, they can have substantial CSS styling.

We've used simple examples before.  For instance, we can create an interactive
function in just a few lines:

```#python
import ipywidgets

@ipywidgets.interact(name = ['Weezer', 'Nerf Herder', 'Mustard Plug'])
def print_bandname(name):
    print(name)
```

This creates a dropdown that we can select an item from, which is supplied.
What this is doing implicitly is creating a widget with a `value` attribute,
and whenever that `value` is changed, the function is called again.

---

## Widget Types 1

Automatically creating widgets using `@ipywidgets.interact` is very handy and
useful for quick operations, but we can do this more deliberately as well.
There are a number of widgets available in `ipywidgets` already:

 * `IntSlider`, `FloatSlider`, `IntRangeSlider`, `FloatRangeSlider`,
   `IntProgress` and `FloatProgress` all display or allow the user to choose
   values.
 * `IntText`, `FloatText`, `BoundedIntText` and `BoundedFloatText` let the user
   input explicit values to a widget.

---

## Widget Types 2

There are additional widget types that can provide indicators or restricted
selections.

 * `ToggleButton`, `Checkbox` and `Valid` provide boolean indicators; `Valid`
   is read-only.
 * For selection, there are `Dropdown`, `RadioButtons`, `Select`,
   `SelectionSlider` and several others.
 * Strings can be provided using `Text`, `TextArea` and `HTML`.
 * Actions can be enabled through `Button` objects.

Widgets can also be laid out using `HBox`, `VBox`, `Tab`, and `Accordion`.

---

## Events and Linking

In addition to watching for changes, we can watch for events and we can link
two (or more) values between different widgets.  

The special method `on_click` on a `Button` allows for a function to be called
when something is clicked.  We can also link using `ipywidgets.link` and
supplying traits.  For example:

```#python
m = MyObject(name = "Weezer", age=26)
l = ipywidgets.Label()
ipywidgets.link((m, 'name'), (l, 'value'))

display(l)

m.name = 'Nerf Herder'
```

**Exercise:** Add a button and make this change occur when clicked.
