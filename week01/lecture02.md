# Data Visualization

## Matthew Turk
## Fall 2020 - BOU/BOG

# Why?

(Or rather, why _wouldn't_ we visualize?)

notes:
Not everything suits itself to visualization -- and part of the reason for that
is the necessary reductionism that visualization can require.

notes:
"There are lots of thing you can compare on a graph / Like who is the shortest
or the tallest giraffe / You can chart how much you walk / How much that you
laugh / There are lots of things you can compare on a graph"

"But the one thing you can't chart / Is how you feel in your heart"

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/fov.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
Visual information is communicated through our eyes, where it is processed.  At
the most basic level, we can see a range of about 210 degrees horizontally with
one or both eyes.  The region that is covered by both ("binocular") is about
114 degrees in extent.

You can only cram so much information into the human eye.

notes:
When we think about visual communication of information, we *must* think about
how human physiology interacts with that communication.

Also, fair warning: I'm not a medical doctor.

This diagram shows the visual acuity of a "standard" human eye, as a function
of angular distance from the fovea.  We have to think about this in
*conjunction* with our field of view.

## Your brain does interpolation

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dotsillusion.jpg" data-background-size="auto 50%" -->

There are 12 dots, can you count them all at the same time?


---

## Your brain does interpolation

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/blindspotcross.png" data-background-size="auto" -->

1. Look at the cross
2. Close left eye, keep looking at the cross
3. Slowly move your head toward & away from screen until dot disappears

---

## Your brain does interpolation

Even despite these oddities, the visual cortex is great for information transfer!  

Your visual cortex is processing information from different parts of this page **at the same time** -- it can do impressive things very quickly!

---

## Can you spot the difference?

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Can-You-Spot-the-10-Differences-in-This-Picture-_585659516-Ksenya-Savva.jpg" data-background-size="auto 75%" -->

notes:
compare this to how long it would take to spot differences in 2 songs - you'd have to listen to both songs (probably more than once) and compare after!  This would be sequential rather than parallel data transfer!

---

## Try it with sound

* [Moonlight Sonata, 1](https://soundcloud.com/redreapergrell/beethoven-moonlight-sonata)
* [Moonlight Sonata, 2](https://soundcloud.com/user-37232775/sets/beethoven-moonlight-sonata)

Try doing the same thing with these on your own!

notes:
time this activity, give them 1.5 minutes

ask: how long did this take you?  How many differences were there?
I spotted tempo as one (but you can cheat by looking at the timer on the bottom!)

Also, you can look at how different each of the sound-bars are on each link and see how different the music looks visually!

---

## Why visualize?

Visualization **augments** human data analysis capabilities:

 * It enhances our ability to pattern find
 * It allows us to summarize data quickly
 * It allows us to search our data quickly

## I need a volunteer!

notes:
(This part is a bit of a stunt.  Sorry.)

| 2007-04-01 | 14422.3 |
| 2007-07-01 | 14569.7 |
| 2007-10-01 | 14685.3 |

| 2008-10-01 | 14549.9 |
| 2009-01-01 | 14383.9 |

notes:
See what I mean?  It's a stunt.  You're supposed to hear these, or look at the
numbers, and not have as clear an impression.  It also takes a lot longer.

![FRED Graph](images/fredgraph.png)

notes:
You might immediately notice a few things about this image, but one item that
we will talk about as class goes on is that often visualizations can have a
consistent style.  FRED in particular has a "branding" that is quite obvious,
even without the logo.

## Anscombe's Quartet

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Anscombe%27s_quartet_3.svg/1280px-Anscombe%27s_quartet_3.svg.png" data-background-size="auto 50%" -->

This famous example shows 4 datasets with the exact same mean, variance and correlation coefficient.

Statistics can be useful, but visualization generated context!

## Anscombe's Quartet -- Dinosaur Edition

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*W--cGoA3_n2ZlU6Xs4o2iQ.gif" data-background-size="auto 50%" -->

Statistics can be useful, but visualization generated context!

# Who are you visualizing for?

* For yourself?
* For a peer?
* For someone else?

notes:
*Whenever* you build a visualization you need to think about the context that
you can assume on the part of your viewer.

---

# Tenet 1:

"Visualizing data" is not a strict subset of "making an image."

 * Collection of the data
 * Organization of that data
 * Representation of that data

notes:
We will approach visualization as encompassing several different stages in the
collection, organization and representation of data.

---

# Tenet 2:

We tell lies to visualize, but we _must_ be honest.

 * No representation is going to convey the entire complexity of a dataset.
 * Some representations are better than others.

---

# Tenet 2:

"The Principle of Proportional Ink" -- [callingbullshit.org](https://callingbullshit.org/)
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/proportionalInk.png" data-background-size="auto 50%" -->

notes:
So let's first talk about how misleading visualizations can be. This 3D pie chart violates the "principle of proportional ink" which states that the number of pixels that represent a value should be proportional to the value. With the raised edge on the pie chart, the blue wedge gets way more ink than it deserves and you get a disproportionate sense of value.

---

# Tenet 2:

"Spurious Correlations" -- [tylervigen.com](https://tylervigen.com/)

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/spurious.png" data-background-size="auto 50%" -->

notes:
you can have a lot of absurd fun with data - but when data is presented in a visualization, people often believe the authority of it even if it's outlandish. 

This website has some good ideas of where to find sample datasets for upcoming homework assignments too!

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/barCharts.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
Each of these bar chart examples are meant to show the same data. But you can see how they're a bit problematic.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/gunDeaths.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
Now here's an example that's more brazen. I'll give you a minute to analyze this and tell me what's wrong with this graph.

Some people will claim the Y-axis should always start from the bottom - at zero - to avoid confusion.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/keelingCurve.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
however, the Keeling Curve is an interesting counter-argument. This is the famous graph that was the original evidence for global warming, showing the rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide was growing. 

Does anyone know why it's generally accepted to show the y-axis like this, without it starting at the zero axis?

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

notes:
here are a few more representations of data that you've probably run into!


---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/battery.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<div style="padding-top: 15em;" data-markdown=true>

 1. Sensors read the current "fill" of the battery
    * Analog / digital conversion
    * Normalized with respect to expected "full"
 1. This is then scaled to a percentage
 1. The battery image is filled from left to right
 1. The image is then rasterized and displayed

</div>

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_bw.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

 * Some fixed maximum amount of damage
 * Each time damage is taken, decrement
 * Each time damage is reversed, increment
 * Display number of hearts as appropriate

---

2 out of 3 "points"

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_color.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/hearts_color.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

![](images/doom_status.png)

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/stitch_bg.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

notes:
This is a screenshot from the movie "Lilo and Stitch" where the little girl Lilo is graphing how much evil is in the alien Stitch. It borrows from a familiar visual - the thermometer. But how could this visualization be misinterpreted? How is it different from a thermometer?

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/stitch_nobg.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

notes:
The angle can be misleading. So can the relative width of the head vs the feet. The surface area is not consistent from top to bottom. Also there are empty areas in the mouth and eyes!


---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/stitch_nobg_tilted.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

notes:
If we rotate the image so that the red liquid is level, do we get a different impression for how much bad is in Stitch?

## Honesty

Our choices must be:

 * Deliberate
 * Informed
 * Motivated
 * Justifiable

## Election Maps

Mark Newman of the University of Michigan has created visualizations of the
election maps from several of the most recent elections.  For more information
and context, see his page http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/ .

 * [Map 1](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/statemapredbluer1024.png)
 * [Map 2](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/statepopredblue1024.png)
 * [Map 3](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countymapredbluer1024.png)
 * [Map 4](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countymappurpler1024.png)
 * [Map 5](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/countycartpurple1024.png)

notes:
These are great, but some criticisms might be that the color red is more apparent to the human eye than the color blue. And in the population-to-area adjusted maps, it's difficult to read for people used to geographic accuracy.

Map1 - this is just a geographical map of red and blue

Map2 - cartogram weighted by population (note, NOT by electoral college population)

Map3 - election results by county

Map4 - percentage of votes by county

Map5 - percentage of votes by county, weighted by population

## This week: Wrap-up

 1. We visualize to change how we understand things.
 1. We visualize data for ourselves, for our peers, and for others.
 1. Visualization is a series of steps that we take to produce a different
    representation of data.

## Assignment 1

 * Identify three visualizations in pop culture -- *not* academic literature.
   This could be, for instance, from:
   * Movies / TV / Music videos
   * Everyday life
   * Advertisements
 * Describe each one in detail
   * Where did the data come from?
   * Is the data quantitative, qualitative, categorical, etc?
   * How was the data processed before being displayed?
   * What method was used to display that data?
 * Replicate the visualization with different, but similarly “shaped,” data
   * By hand is acceptable
   * Computational methods should include source code
