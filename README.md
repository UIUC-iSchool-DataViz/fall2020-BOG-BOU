# Course Template

This repository is a template for managing coursework using GitHub pages.  It
uses the theme [dinky](https://github.com/pages-themes/dinky),
[nbviewer.js](https://github.com/kokes/nbviewer.js), and
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for presenting material.

For each week of class, create a subdirectory `weekZZ` (where `ZZ` is the week
of the class) and place any `.ipynb` and `.md` files in that directory.
Lectures can utilize the layout `lecture`, which will present them in revealjs.

## Notes on Course Materials

As of Fall 2020, this section and the [section developed in parallel by Jill
Naiman](https://github.com/UIUC-iSchool-DataViz/is445AOG_fall2020/) have
diverged somewhat.  Occasionally, contributions will be passed back and forth
and the commit message history may not reflect the original authorship.

These two repositories have been developed in collaboration, and authorship is
shared between Matthew Turk and Jill Naiman.
