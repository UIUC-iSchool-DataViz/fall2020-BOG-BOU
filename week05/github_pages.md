description: Demonstrate how to put a vega-lite visualization on a webpage
---

Your assignment for this week is to build a web page on GitHub pages (which can
be with a "burner account", as long as you supply that info to us) that
includes a vega-lite visualization of the building inventory dataset.

This will have three steps:

 1. Develop a visualization using vega-lite using the building inventory data
 2. Deploy this visualization in JSON format to your GitHub pages
 3. Write the initialization javascript code to create the visualization in your page

You will have a week and a half to do this, as we have not covered quite enough
yet to make this work.
