title: Demonstrating Relationships
layout: assignment
description: Show relationships between two variables using the building inventory
---

Using one of the tools that we have discussed (matplotlib or vega-lite),
construct a visualization of the Illinois Building Inventory that communicates
the following information:

 * Relationship between the year acquired and the year constructed
 * Total square footage as a function of congressional district
 * Average square footage per floor as a function of congressional district
 * Square footage for the five most common departments as a function of year

Each component will be worth 5 points and *must* be a completely communicative
visualization -- including labels and a one paragraph writeup of successes and
shortcomings in your approach.  Submit a notebook or a set of JSON gists to
Moodle.  All source code must be in these files.
