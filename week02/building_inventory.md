title: Demonstrating Relationships
layout: assignment
description: Show relationships between two variables using the building inventory
---

The purpose of this assignment is to get some practice using Pandas to filter
and aggregate data and use the outputs of these processes in plots.  Using one
of the tools that we have discussed (matplotlib and/or pandas), construct a
visualization of the Illinois Building Inventory that communicates the
following information -- choose 3 out of the 4 listed below to visualize:

 * Relationship between the year acquired and the year constructed
 * Total square footage as a function of congressional district ("Congress Dist")
 * Average square footage per floor as a function of congressional district
 * Square footage for the five most common departments (aka "Agency Name") as a
   function of year.  Here "most common" refers to the departments with the most
   entries in the table.  You can choose year acquired or year constructed (or
   some sort of average of the two!), just make sure you state which you chose
   and why.

Each component will be worth 10 points (5 for code and 5 for writeup of your
narrative discussing your process what things did/did not work) and must be a
completely communicative visualization -- including labels and a one paragraph
writeup of successes and shortcomings in your approach. Submit a notebook or a
set of JSON gists to Moodle. All source code must be in these files.
