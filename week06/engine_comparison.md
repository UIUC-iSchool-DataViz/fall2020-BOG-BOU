description: Compare and contrast visualization engines
---

Your assignment is to pick four of the following possibilities and write up a
set of comparisons for constructing the *same* visualization.   You must evaluate matplotlib, vega-lite and bqplot, and you can choose one of the following in addition: D3, Bokeh, Plotly, R/RStudio.

These comparisons should be:

 * What is the license for the software?
 * What is the focus of the software?
 * Does it have interactivity, and how easy is it?
 * What are the pros and cons of using it?

These should total roughly half a page per engine.
